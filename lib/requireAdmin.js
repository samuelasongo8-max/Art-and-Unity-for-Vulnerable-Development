/**
 * lib/requireAdmin.js — the single gate in front of every write.
 *
 * There is exactly one admin and no public registration, so the only question
 * any protected endpoint asks is "does this request carry a valid admin
 * session?". This module answers it, in ONE place, so a new endpoint cannot
 * accidentally forget the check.
 *
 * THE CONTRACT FOR CALLERS
 * -----------------------
 * Call it FIRST, before reading a body, touching the database, or doing any
 * other work. On success it returns the admin's email. On any failure it has
 * ALREADY written a 401 to the response and returns null, so the caller's
 * whole pattern is:
 *
 *     const email = requireAdmin(req, res);
 *     if (!email) return;
 *
 * The session is a JWT in an httpOnly cookie, so the browser's JavaScript can
 * never read the token — not on the admin's machine, not through an XSS bug.
 * That is the whole reason the token is never kept in localStorage.
 *
 * SECURITY
 * --------
 * The token is never returned in a JSON body and never logged, neither the
 * token itself nor its contents. Only the FACT that a verification failed is
 * recorded, never the value that was checked.

 * answers 401 forever even though login reported success. The same applies to

 *
 * In production nothing is weakened: Vercel terminates TLS and forwards the
 * original scheme in `x-forwarded-proto`, so the cookie is still marked `Secure`
 * on every real request there.
 *
 * `Secure` is only dropped when the connection is positively known to be plain
 * http. If the request carries no socket at all (a unit test, a stubbed req) the
 * answer is treated as unknown and `Secure` is kept, so the safe default always
 * wins.
