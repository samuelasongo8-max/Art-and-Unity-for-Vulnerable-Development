   CORS — ONE middleware, MODIFIED in place (it replaced the old
   `app.use(cors())`; there is only ever one here).

   The frontend is deployed separately on Vercel and calls this API on Render,
   so every request is CROSS-ORIGIN and two things must both be true:

   1. credentials: true — the admin session is an httpOnly cookie, so the
      browser has to be allowed to send and store it cross-origin.
   2. an EXPLICIT origin — the cors library's default sends
      `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, and a browser REJECTS that outright when
      the request's credentials mode is "include":
      "The value of the 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header must not be the
      wildcard '*' when the request's credentials mode is 'include'."
      That mismatch is exactly the error this configuration exists to prevent.
      It is not merely untidy: with "*" no admin request can ever carry the
      session cookie, so login silently fails everywhere.

   ALLOWED_ORIGINS is a comma-separated list, so new deployments can be added as
   a variable instead of a code change. The wildcard is explicitly stripped even
   if someone puts it in the list, because "*" with credentials is invalid.

   LOCAL DEVELOPMENT FALLBACK
   ---------------------------
   When ALLOWED_ORIGINS is unset the list falls back to the Vite dev origins, so
   `npm run dev:server` works out of the box. It falls back to NAMED localhost
   origins, never to "*": a named list is the only thing compatible with
   credentials.

   THE VERCEL FUNCTIONS, RUN LOCALLY
   ==========================================================================
   Everything under /api/ is a Vercel serverless function. In production Vercel
   builds and runs them itself. Locally nothing was executing them: this file
   only defined /api/health and /api/contact, so vite's proxy forwarded
   /api/admin/setup-status to a route that did not exist and the browser got a
   404 (or an opaque ECONNREFUSED 500 when this server was not running at all).

   The mount below imports those SAME files and calls their default export with
   the same (req, res) contract Vercel uses. It is not a re-implementation and
   not a mock: the real handler runs, against the real MongoDB, with the real
   env vars. If a route behaves differently here than on Vercel, that is a bug
   in the route, which is exactly what you want to find out locally.

   The only adaptations are the ones the Vercel runtime provides for free:
     - req.query, built from the path (Vercel does this for [id] segments)
     - res.status().json(), which Vercel's Node helpers add to the response
