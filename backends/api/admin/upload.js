/**
 * /api/admin/upload — stores an image chosen by an admin in the dashboard.
 *
 *   POST /api/admin/upload      raw image bytes
 *     -> 200 { ok: true, url, width, height }
 *     -> 401 the caller has no valid admin session
 *     -> 413 the file is larger than the limit
 *     -> 415 the file is not a JPG / PNG / WEBP
 *
 * WHY RAW BYTES AND NOT multipart/form-data
 * -----------------------------------------
 * A multipart upload needs a parser, and the project has none. Adding one to
 * handle a single endpoint would be more code than the endpoint itself. The
 * browser can send a File as the request body directly, and Node hands it over
 * as a Buffer, so the whole feature needs no new dependency at all. The
 * filename travels in a header instead of the body.
 *
 * The trade-off is stated plainly: this endpoint accepts one image per request
 * and nothing else. It cannot carry extra form fields, because it is not a form.
 * The dashboard uploads the image first and then saves the post with the URL it
 * gets back, which is why the image survives a refresh — it is already on disk
 * and in the database before the post is ever written.
 *
 * AUTHENTICATION
 * --------------
 * requireAdmin() runs before a single byte is read or decoded, so an anonymous
 * request cannot upload anything at all, cannot make the server spend CPU
 * decoding a file, and cannot learn whether the endpoint exists beyond the 401.
 *
 * ENVIRONMENT
 *   JWT_SECRET   the same secret every other admin route uses
