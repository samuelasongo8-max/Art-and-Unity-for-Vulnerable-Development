/**
 * /api/admin/setup-status — has the one admin account been created yet?
 *
 *   GET /api/admin/setup-status  ->  200 { ok: true, hasAdmin: true | false }
 *
 * WHY THIS IS PUBLIC
 * ------------------
 * The login form has to know which of the two forms to show — "create your
 * account" or "log in" — and the footer link is on every page, so the answer
 * is needed before anything is signed in.
 *
 * It is public because what it returns is not sensitive. It is a single
 * boolean saying whether setup has happened, which the person asking can
 * already establish for themselves: they either know they created the account,
 * or they can try to log in and see. Nothing about the account itself — no
 * email, no hash, no created date — is ever returned.
 *
 * The one thing worth being honest about: while `hasAdmin: false`, this
 * endpoint is an open door. The correct response is not to hide the boolean,
 * it is to create the account promptly. The register endpoint is designed so
 * that even if someone walks through that door first, the damage is bounded —
 * they get one admin account, and no second one is ever possible.
 *
 * NO CACHING
 * ----------
 * The answer is explicitly not cached. A cached `hasAdmin: false` would show
 * the register form to someone whose account already exists, and a cached
 * `true` would hide the setup form from the person who still needs it. It has
 * to be read live every time, which sendJson() already arranges.
 *
 * SIGNATURE
 * ---------
 * Vercel calls the default export as (req, res); the answer is written on res,
 * matching api/subscribe.js.
 *
 * ENVIRONMENT (Vercel -> Production)
 *   MONGODB_URI   the connection string, never prefixed with VITE_
