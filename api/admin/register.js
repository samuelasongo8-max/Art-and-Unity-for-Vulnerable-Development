/**
 * /api/admin/register — creates THE one admin account, and only ever once.
 *
 *   POST /api/admin/register  { email, password }
 *     -> 201 { ok: true, email }   the account was created, and you are signed in
 *     -> 403 { ok: false, error: "An admin account already exists." }
 *     -> 400 { ok: false, error: "Invalid email or password format." }
 *
 * WHY THIS IS SAFE TO LEAVE REACHABLE
 * -----------------------------------
 * A public registration endpoint is normally the worst thing you can add to a
 * site. This one is safe for exactly one reason: it stops working the instant
 * an account exists, and it can never create a second one.
 *
 * The rule is enforced by the DATABASE, not by a check — see lib/adminSetup.js
 * for the full reasoning. In short: the document is written with a fixed `_id`
 * and behind a unique index, so two requests racing each other cannot both
 * succeed. There is no window in which a second account can appear.
 *
 * Once the account exists, this endpoint is permanently closed: the first
 * thing every request does is look for an existing admin and answer 403. That
 * is what "first one wins" means in practice.
 *
 * CREATING THE ACCOUNT ALSO LOGS YOU IN
 * --------------------------------------
 * A successful registration signs the same JWT and sets the same httpOnly
 * cookie that api/admin/login.js sets, so the new admin lands on the dashboard
 * without a second round trip. The token goes out through the Set-Cookie header
 * only and is never placed in the response body.
 *
 * WHAT THE CALLER IS TOLD
 * -----------------------
 * Only two failure messages exist: "An admin account already exists." and
 * "Invalid email or password format." The first is safe to show because it
 * reveals nothing an attacker did not already have to know. Neither reveals
 * anything about a stored account — no email, no hash, nothing.
 *
 * SECURITY
 * --------
 * The password is never logged and never stored in plain text: it is hashed
 * with bcrypt at cost 12 before the insert, and the hash is not logged either.
 * The submitted email is masked in the log, exactly as login.js does.
 *
 * There is no rate limit here, and that is a deliberate trade-off worth
 * naming: once an account exists every call is a cheap 403 that costs no bcrypt
 * work. Before the account exists, the only thing an attacker can do by
 * spamming it is create the account themselves — which they could equally do
 * with a single call. The answer to that window is to set the account up
 * promptly, not to slow the attacker down.
 *
 * SIGNATURE
 * ---------
 * Vercel calls the default export as (req, res) and the answer must be WRITTEN
 * on res, so every path below ends in sendJson() — the same convention as
 * api/subscribe.js and api/admin/login.js.
 *
 * ENVIRONMENT (Vercel -> Production)
 *   MONGODB_URI      the connection string, never prefixed with VITE_
 *   JWT_SECRET       the signing secret
 *   JWT_EXPIRES_IN   optional, e.g. "7d"
